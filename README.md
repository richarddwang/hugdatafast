# hugdatafast
The elegant integration of huggingface/nlp and fastai2.

# Install
`pip install hugdatafast`  
**Note**: If your fastai2 is editable install, re editable install fastai2 again after install this. 

# Furture Plan
- Merge it to fastai2 and huggingface/nlp respectively, after I complete my personal project that this is developed along with. (serveral months later).
- The implemenatation of `ConcatTransform` works but might be too complexed to extend, so I may discuss with huggingface to see how to improve it.
- Currently, it is designed to work with the dataset part of huggingface/nlp, I may also integrate metric part of it.
