# hugdatafast
The elegant integration of huggingface/nlp and fastai, and some handy data transformation for huggingface/nlp.

ðŸŽ“ **Documentation** : https://hugdatafast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

# Install
`pip install hugdatafast`

# Furture Plan
- I would like to merge this library to fastai and huggingface/nlp respectively. But I may have no time for it. You're welcome to pr this library to the two libraries.

- The implemenatation of `CombineTransform` works but might be too complexed to extend, hope HuggingFace or someone come up with some great ideas.

- Currently, it is designed to work with the dataset part of huggingface/nlp, I may also integrate the part of metric or not.
